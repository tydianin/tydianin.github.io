        <h3>Office Technician</h3>
        <h5>California Department of Tax and Fee Administration<br>
          June 2017</h5><br>
        <p>I ensure that the sales, use, and special tax payments from the citizens and businesses of California are
          processed in an efficient and effective manner. Over the course of five years, I have successfully led
          projects to modernize several processes and procedures, drastically decreasing service time without
          compromising quality.</p><br>
        <p>In late 2020, I began assisting our analytical and managerial staff with automating several of our processes
          through implementation of programming best practices and technologies. While my abilities were limited by my
          classification, this real-world experience was invaluable for my career change pursuits.</p><br>
